### Hi there 👋

My name is Omar, I am a self-taught Software Engineer with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

I'm currently working on an app called Collabtime. Collabtime is a task and project management app built with React, Redux, NodeJS, Express, WebSockets, and MongoDB.

* [Collabtime Frontend Repo](https://github.com/gastelumdev/collabtime-vite)
* [Collabtime Backend Repo](https://github.com/gastelumdev/collabtime-ts-backend)
* Visit my website [here](https://gastelumdev.onrender.com) for access to the application.

I am also actively learning how to contribute to open-source projects.
